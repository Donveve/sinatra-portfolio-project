This is a barebones resource intended to help homeschooling families keep track of their children's school and musical requirement.

Mom and Dad can create a log-in.
Each child can have their own login.
The parent log in controls which subjects and instruments are available.  They can also view the record of each child to see what they have completed on a particular day.

Each child can access their record for the day and update what assignments they have completed.

Future versions will include:
  - Daily record keeping for a more complete system.
  - Ability for parent to assign particular subjects to a student, instead of all subjects being displayed.
